*DESCRIPTION*:
In this project, we aim to develop an AI-powered recommendation system using Java and Apache Mahout. The system will suggest products or content to users based on their preferences and behaviors. Recommendation systems are widely used in e-commerce, streaming services, and online marketplaces to enhance user experience by providing personalized suggestions.

The primary goal of this project is to build a Java-based program that implements a recommendation engine capable of processing sample data and generating meaningful recommendations. This system will leverage collaborative filtering techniques, which analyze user interactions to make accurate predictions.

Technologies Used
Java - The core programming language used to build the application.
Apache Mahout - A machine learning library designed for scalable recommendation systems.
Apache Hadoop (Optional) - Can be used for handling large datasets if scalability is required.
MySQL or NoSQL Databases (Optional) - To store user and product data.
IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) - Development environment for coding and testing.
Project Implementation
The recommendation system will be built using the following steps:

Data Collection & Preparation

Gather sample user-product interaction data.
Structure data in a format suitable for Mahout (e.g., user-item matrix).
Setting Up Apache Mahout in Java

Install and configure Apache Mahout in the Java environment.
Import necessary Mahout libraries.
Building the Recommendation Model

Use collaborative filtering techniques such as:
User-Based Filtering: Suggests items based on the preferences of similar users.
Item-Based Filtering: Suggests items based on the similarity between products.
Implement the Mahout Recommender class to generate recommendations.
Generating Recommendations

Use Mahoutâ€™s GenericUserBasedRecommender or GenericItemBasedRecommender to process data and suggest relevant items.
Optimize the recommendation algorithm for better accuracy.
Testing & Evaluation

Run the program with test data.
Evaluate the recommendation results using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Precision-Recall.
Final Deliverable

A Java-based working recommendation system.
Sample dataset used for testing.
Proper documentation explaining the code and implementation.
Expected Outcome
A functional recommendation engine that suggests relevant products or content based on user preferences.
An efficient Java program integrated with Apache Mahout for generating recommendations.
A better understanding of collaborative filtering and recommendation system algorithms.
